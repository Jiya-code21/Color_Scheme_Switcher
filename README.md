# Color_Scheme_Switcher

I just created a simple Background Color Switcher project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🤔 What is this?
⭐️ It’s an interactive page where you can click on color buttons to change the background color instantly.

🤔 Why did I make this?
⭐️ I wanted to explore JavaScript events and bring a creative idea to life while learning web development.

🤔 How it works?
⭐️ Each color button has an event listener that changes the page’s background based on your selection.

Try it out 🚀 🙂
