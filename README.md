# Color_Scheme_Switcher

I just created a simple Background Color Switcher project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

What is this?
It’s an interactive page where you can click on color buttons to change the background color instantly.

Why did I make this?
I wanted to explore JavaScript events and bring a creative idea to life while learning web development.

How it works?
Each color button has an event listener that changes the page’s background based on your selection. Try it out.
